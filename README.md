End-to-End Audiobook Customer Prediction
Project Overview

This project predicts whether a customer will purchase again after listening to an audiobook. Itâ€™s a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline starting from raw data, through preprocessing and exploratory analysis, to multiple model implementations (Logistic Regression and Deep Learning).

The project demonstrates:

Handling real-world customer behavioral data
Performing EDA and outlier treatment
Applying feature scaling and preprocessing
Training and evaluating classification models
Comparing Logistic Regression vs Deep Learning performance

Tech Stack

Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, tensorflow/keras

 Workflow

Initial Data Check & EDA
Understand dataset structure
Identify missing values & distributions
Outlier Treatment
Remove/adjust extreme values using statistical methods
Feature Scaling
Apply normalization/standardization for model stability
Modeling
Logistic Regression (baseline model)
Deep Learning (dense neural network classifier)
Evaluation
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
ROC Curve, AUC comparison

Results

Logistic Regression achieved 93% accuracy but F1 score is only 47%

Deep Learning model accuracy was 88% but we can see a significant improvement in F1 score to 63%
We have used SMOTE to reduce the inbalance in the daseset and thus we acheived this result.

Insights: Customer engagement features like Minutes Listened and Completion Percentage were strong predictors.
